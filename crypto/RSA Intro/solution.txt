The Formula to make the private key and decrypt the flag are listed in the challenge description

For the private key, totient is already provided:
d = pow(e, -1, tot) # e ^ -1 (mod) tot

And to decrypt:
m = pow(c,d,n) # c ^ d (mod) n

and to turn the number into a readable flag:
M = long_to_bytes(m)
