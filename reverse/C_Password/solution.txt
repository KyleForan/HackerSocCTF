There are 3 ways to solve this challenge:

1. Strings
"strings" is a command to view sequences of printable characters.
Here we can use it to find the 3 parts of the flag.
strings cpass_32

2. Disassembly
Using a disassembler such as ghidra or dogbolts we can see the source code of the program.
Looking through 3 flag part variables can be found.
https://dogbolt.org/ or sudo apt install ghidra

3. GDB
The most complicated way is to live debug the program, 
this means to extract the flag from memory when the program is running,
While over the top for this challenge it is useful to learn for other challenges.

First we look through the functions to find where the password is loaded into memory,
In this program it is the strcmp function call.

Running the program through GDB, we can break at the strcmp call instruction, 
Then we run the program and when it hits the breakpoint we can view the arguments passed in
one of which will be the flag

gdb cpass_32/cpass_64
disass main
b* <address of strcmp call>
r
<enter anything>
# For 32 bit
telescope
# For 64 bit
x/s $rdi
